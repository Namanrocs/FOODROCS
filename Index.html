					<p class="secsubtag text-small">About: marbella's is this quaint, pretty-looking cafe that's sure to give you spain-like feels. Inspired by the owner nikhil chawla's travels to europe, the decor is colourful, minimal and fuss-free. Ever seen a coconut tree inside a washroom? No, right? Well, there is one inside the toilet to retain that connect with nature at the cafe,.there is also a mango tree right in the middle of this garage-turned-cafe just to keep intact those natural elements.  The space is divided into three zones - first is the al-fresco setting for sun-kissed mornings with a lot of natural light coming in, second is the 'isoulation' section if privacy is what you seek or wish to work while enjoying a cup of freshly-brewed coffee and the last one is the indoor section done up in soothing colours and pretty lights.<br>
